    <p>In July my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother and elder brother, a prey to the blinding
        white heat of the summer days. Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book of holidays, its pages
        blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="morningscontainer">
            <div class="morningstext">   
    <h3 id="luminous-mornings">Luminous Mornings</h3>
    <p>On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like Pomona emerging from the flames of day, spilling
        from her basket the colourful beauty of the sun - the shiny pink cherries full of juice under their transparent
        skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so much better than they tasted; apricots in whose golden pulp
        lay the core of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry of fruit, she unloaded sides of meat with their
        keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and strength, and seaweeds of vegetables like dead octopuses and squids, the
        raw material of meals with a yet undefined taste, the vegetative and terrestrial ingredients of dinner, exuding
        a wild and rustic smell. </p>
    <p>The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square was shot through each day by the naked heat of
        summer: the silence of the shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming their intense dreams on
        the floor; the sound of a barrel organ rising from the deepest golden vein of day; two or three bars of a
        chorus, played on a distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun on the white pavement, lost in the
        fire of high noon. </p>
    <p>After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semidarkness by drawing down the linen blinds. All colours
        immediately fell an octave lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of the sea and
        the light was reflected in mirrors of green water - and the heat of the day began to breathe on the blinds as
        they stirred slightly in their daydreams. </p>
    <p>"On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. From the dusk of the hallway, we stepped at once
        into the brightness of the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their eyes half closed against the
        glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper lips were drawn back, exposing the teeth. Everyone in this
        golden day wore that grimace of heat as if the sun had forced his worshipers to wear identical masks of gold.
        The old and the young, women and children, greeted each other with these masks, painted on their faces with
        thick gold paint; they smiled at each other's pagan faces, the barbaric smiles of Bacchus." </p>

        <div class="marketcontainer">
            <div class="markettext">   
    <h3 id="market-square">Market Square</h3>
    <p>Market Square was empty and white-hot, swept by hot winds like a biblical desert. The thorny acacias, growing in
        this emptiness, looked with their bright leaves like the trees on old tapestries. Although there was no breath
        of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical gesture, as if wanting to display the elegance of the silver
        lining of their leaves that resembled the fox-fur lining of a nobleman's coat. The old houses, worn smooth by
        the winds of innumerable days, played tricks with the reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and memories of
        colours scattered in the depth of the cloudless sky. It seemed as if whole generations of summer days, like
        patient stonemasons cleaning the mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive varnish, revealing
        more and more clearly the true face of the houses, the features that fate had given them and life had shaped for
        them from the inside. </p>
    <p>Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had fallen asleep; the balconies declared their
        emptiness to heaven; the open doorways smelt of coolness and wine. </p>
    <p>A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from the flaming broom of the heat, beleaguered a
        piece of wall, throwing buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if wishing to read in the horoscope of
        those metal discs the real secret written in the hieroglyphics of cracks and scratched lines. Apart from them,
        the square was deserted. One expected that, any minute, the Samaritan's donkey, led by the bridle, would stop in
        front of the wine merchant's vaulted doorway and that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the
        red-hot saddle and carry him slowly up the cool stairs to the floor above, already redolent of the Sabbath. </p>
    <p>Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market Square, guiding our broken shadows along the
        houses as over a keyboard. </p>
    <p>Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones slowly filed past some the pale pink of human skin, some
        golden, some blue-gray, all flat, warm and velvety in the sun, like sundials, trodden to the point of
        obliteration, into blessed nothingness. </p>

    <p>And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the shadow of the chemist's shop. A large jar of
        raspberry juice in the wide window symbolised the coolness of balms which can relieve all kinds of pain. After
        we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain any pretence of urbanity, like a man returning to his
        little village who, piece by piece, strips off his Sunday best, slowly changing back into a peasant as he gets
        closer to his home. </p>
    <p>The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the exuberant tangle of blossom in their little gardens.
        Overlooked by the light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds luxuriated quietly, glad of the interval for
        dreams beyond the margin of time on the borders of an endless day. An enormous sunflower, lifted on a powerful
        stem and suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the yellow mourning of the last sorrowful days of its life, bent
        under the weight of its monstrous girth. But the naive, suburban bluebells and unpretentious dimity flowers
        stood helpless in their starched pink and white shifts, indifferent to the sunflower's tragedy. </p>
